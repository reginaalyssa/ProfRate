# ProfRate

Supposedly a wordplay for *proofread* and a shortened made-up word for "Rate your/my/our Professor," **ProfRate** is a an application built using Ruby on Rails that lets you, as the title suggests, rate your professor. You can leave reviews (what we collectively call the ratings and comments) on your chosen professor for a specific subject. Ratings are on a scale of 1 to 5 (5 being the best, and 1 being the worst).
